So hospitals are providing ventilators to support the patients and due to the huge number of cases, there is a shortage of ventilators. There are some that can be used as a ventilator live BVM ventilator. But this involves a controller person who will control the Bag. And it is a high risk to have someone near to an infected person. So this product fills the need of the supporting person with the help of an automated machine for pumping Bag Valve Mask. This is a ventilator product that can be used by hospitals for patients who are facing breathing problems. This is a mechatronics-engineered product that consists of Bag Valve Mask which is used for BVM Ventilation. This ventilation is an alternative and most effective ventilation process, when the person canâ€™t breathe on their own, BVM pushes air to the lungs. But pushing air to the lungs involves monitoring many external parameters like heart rate and lung Inflation. This product will ensure the monitoring of both cases at the same time.
